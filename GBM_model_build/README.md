## Gradient Boosting Modeling Approach
The parameters used to build out the GBM will be derived from the set of both team-based and player-based data. The model will be built using data from the 2009/2010 season to the 2016/2017 season. We will be using data from the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 season as our validation segments.
